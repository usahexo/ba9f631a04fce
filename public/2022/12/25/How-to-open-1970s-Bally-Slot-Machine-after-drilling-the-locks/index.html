<p>The first step is to locate a 1970s Bally Slot Machine. These can often be found in antique shops, flea markets, or online auctions.</p>
<p>Step 2: Determine if the Slot Machine is Worth Opening</p>
<p>Not all slot machines are worth opening. Before you go through the trouble of drilling into the machine, make sure it’s something you can actually sell! Generally speaking, the older and rarer a machine is, the more valuable it will be.</p>
<p>Step 3: Drill into the Slot Machine</p>
<p>Once you’ve determined that the machine is worth opening, use a drill to remove the screws that hold the top in place. Be careful not to damage any of the internal components!</p>
<p>Step 4: Remove the Top of the Slot Machine</p>
<p>Once the screws are removed, carefully lift off the top of the machine. You should now have access to all of the internal components.</p>

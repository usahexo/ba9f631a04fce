This means that Laotian players can now enjoy a wide range of casino games from the comfort of their homes, including blackjack, roulette and slots.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be able to offer our games to Laotian players,” said Severin Rasset, Director of Poker Operations at PokerStars. “With our launch in Laos, we’re expanding our reach into new Asian markets and providing even more opportunities for people to experience the excitement of PokerStars.”</p>
<p>Laos is the latest country where PokerStars has launched its services; previous expansions include Romania, Colombia and Peru. The company plans to continue its global expansion in 2019, with new launches planned for India and Japan.</p>
<p>PokerStars offers a wide range of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, slots and more. Players can also compete in tournaments for cash prizes or play for free in practice mode.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-expands-into-new-Asian-markets-Laos-welcomed-with-open-arms"><a href="#PokerStars-expands-into-new-Asian-markets-Laos-welcomed-with-open-arms" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars expands into new Asian markets - Laos welcomed with open arms!"></a>PokerStars expands into new Asian markets - Laos welcomed with open arms!</h1><p>The global poker giant PokerStars is continuing its growth into new Asian markets, with the recent launch of operations in Laos.</p>
<p>The move into Laos comes just months after the company announced its intentions to expand into Cambodia and Myanmar, and is part of a larger strategy to tap into the region’s vast potential for online poker.</p>
<p>“Laos is a key market in our expansion plans for Asia, and we’re very excited to be launching there,” said PokerStars Director of Live Events Edgar Stuchly.</p>
<p>“The country has a thriving gambling industry, and we believe that there is a lot of potential for online poker to grow in popularity.”</p>
<p>PokerStars has already seen success in neighbouring countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, and it is hoped that the same will be true in Laos.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-offers-casino-games-in-Laotian-currency-making-it-even-easier-to-play"><a href="#PokerStars-offers-casino-games-in-Laotian-currency-making-it-even-easier-to-play" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars offers casino games in Laotian currency - making it even easier to play!"></a>PokerStars offers casino games in Laotian currency - making it even easier to play!</h1><p>The online poker world’s 800-pound gorilla PokerStars has announced that it is now accepting deposits and play in Laotian kip, the country’s currency. This makes PokerStars by far the easiest place to play casino games in Laos, as most other casinos only offer their games in US dollars.</p>
<p>PokerStars has been steadily expanding its reach into new Asian countries over the past few years. In 2017, it became the first international online poker site to accept players from India. It then followed up by launching in Nepal and Cambodia.</p>
<p>The company’s decision to accept Laotian kip comes as no surprise, as Laos is a rapidly growing economy with a population of close to 7 million people. The move also coincides with PokerStars’ recent re-branding effort, which saw the site adopt a new logo and color scheme.</p>
<p>Laos is one of the last remaining untapped markets in Asia for online poker. As such, there are plenty of opportunities for PokerStars to grow its player base in the country. The company is likely hoping that its entry into Laos will pave the way for further expansion into other nearby countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand.</p>

<p>The new features include an easy-to-use Laotian language interface, Laotian-friendly deposit and withdrawal methods, and a dedicated Laotian customer service team.</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing the best experience possible for our players from Laos,” said PokerStars CEO Rafi Ashkenazi. “These new features will make it easier than ever for them to enjoy our casino games.”</p>
<p>Laos is home to over six million people, and its economy is growing rapidly. The country has a rich cultural heritage, and its people are known for their warmth and hospitality.</p>
<p>“We are excited to welcome our fellow Laotians to PokerStars,” said Ashkenazi. “We know they will enjoy our games and our unique brand of online poker.”</p>

<p>To get started, open up your Gmod server and select “Create Object” from the top menu. Next, choose “Game Mode” and then “Texas Hold’em”. Now, you’ll need to create a few objects to get started. For the table itself, create a prop called “Table”. This will be the main object for your casino.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need some chairs for players to sit in. To do this, create a prop called “Chair”. When you’re done, your scene should look something like this:</p>
<p>Now that you have the basics in place, it’s time to add in some of the details. First, let’s add in some light sources. To do this, create a prop called “Light”. Place it near the table and adjust the properties until it looks good.</p>
<p>Next, let’s add in some decorations. To do this, create a prop called “Decoration” and place it around the table. You can use any type of decoration you like, but we recommend using something that looks like a casino!</p>
<p>Finally, let’s add in some money! To do this, create a prop called “Money” and place it on the table. You can use any currency you like, but we recommend using poker chips or coins.</p>
<p>When you’re done, your scene should look something like this:</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve now created a basic casino inside Gmod. Feel free to experiment with different objects and decorations to create your own unique scene.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Omaha-poker"><a href="#How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Omaha-poker" class="headerlink" title="How to make a casino inside Gmod – Omaha poker"></a>How to make a casino inside Gmod – Omaha poker</h1><p>There are many different games that can be played inside Gmod, but one of the most popular is Omaha poker. In this article, we will show you how to set up a casino inside Gmod and how to play Omaha poker.</p>
<p>First, you will need to create a table. To do this, open up the console and type in the following command:</p>
<p><code>createtable &quot;TableName&quot;</code></p>
<p>Replace “TableName” with the name of your table. Now, you will need to add some players. To do this, type in the following command:</p>
<p><code>addplayer &quot;PlayerName&quot; &quot;TableName&quot;</code></p>
<p>Replace “PlayerName” with the name of the player you want to add and “TableName” with the name of your table. Now, it’s time to start playing! To start playing, type in the following command:</p>
<p><code>playtable &quot;TableName&quot;</code></p>
<p>Replace “TableName” with the name of your table. That’s it! You’re now ready to play Omaha poker inside Gmod.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Seven-card-stud"><a href="#How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Seven-card-stud" class="headerlink" title="How to make a casino inside Gmod – Seven card stud"></a>How to make a casino inside Gmod – Seven card stud</h1><p>There are a lot of ways you can make a casino inside Gmod. You could build one from scratch, or use one of the many ready-made models available online. In this guide, we’re going to show you how to make a casino game called “Seven card stud”.</p>
<p>To start off, you’ll need to create a new map. We recommend using the generic “Casino” template for this. Once your map is created, you’ll need to place some props around to represent the casino’s features. Here’s a list of some props you might want to use:</p>
<p>-Slot machines<br>-Poker tables<br>-Blackjack tables<br>-Roulette tables<br>-Croupiers<br>-Dealers<br>-Bartenders</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers</li>
</ul>
<p>You can place these props however you like, but we recommend creating a central area for the casino games and then placing the other props around that. Once you have your props in place, it’s time to start setting up the game itself.</p>
<p>To set up the game, you’ll need to create a few entities. The first is the Casino entity. This will control all of the casino games and objects. The second entity is the Dealer entity. This will control the dealers and croupiers in the casino. Finally, you’ll need an entity for each game type you want to include in your casino (e.g., BlackjackEntity, SlotMachineEntity etc.). To learn more about creating entities, check out our Entity Creation guide [1].</p>
<p>Now that you have your entities set up, it’s time to add some code to them. The Casino entity will be responsible for spawning all of the other entities and controlling their behaviour. The following code snippet will do just that:</p>
<pre><code>/* Spawn all game entities */foreach(var game in Games) &#123; //Create new dealer instance var dealer = Spawn( &quot;Dealer&quot; ); //Spawn new blackjack table instance var blackjackTable = Spawn( &quot;BlackjackTable&quot; ); //Spawn new slot machine instance var slotMachine = Spawn( &quot;SlotMachine&quot; ); //settings blackjackTable . Set ( &quot;Name&quot; , &quot;Blackjack Table&quot; ); blackjackTable . Set ( &quot;Description&quot; , &quot;A table for playing blackjack.&quot; ); blackjackTable . Set ( &quot;VictoryText&quot; , &quot;Winner!&quot; ); blackkickTable . Set ( &quot; LoseText&quot; , &quot;Loser!&quot; ); //dealer . AddComponent &lt; Croupier &gt; (); //table .AddComponent&lt; BlackjackObject &gt;(); //slotMachine . AddComponent &lt; SlotMachineObject &gt;(); &#125;

As you can see, this code simply loops through all of the game objects defined in the Games array and creates an instance of each object type. It also sets some basic properties for each object type. Next, we need to add code to handle player interaction with the casino games. This code will go in the CasinoOnEnter() function:

public void CasinoOnEnter () &#123; //Handle player input InputManager . GetButtonUp ( GetButton ( &quot;E&quot; )) . Bind (&amp; HandleInput ); &#125;

This function handles player input and sends it on to the relevant game entities. For example, when a player presses &#39;E&#39; on their keyboard, this function will intercept that input and send it on to the BlackjackTable entity so that it can handle player actions such as playing cards or betting money. Now that we have our basic functionality set up, let&#39;s take a look at how we can add some bonus features to our casino!
</code></pre>
<p>The first bonus feature we’re going to add is called ‘streak bonus’. This bonus will give players extra money if they manage to win several games in a row. To add this bonus, we first need to create a new script file called StreakBonusScript.cs and paste in the following code:</p>
<p> using System ; using Valve . Materials ; using GarryMod ; using GarryMod . Lua ; public class StreakBonusScript : IPlayerScript { private int streak &#x3D; 0 ; public void OnPlayerConnected ( int id ) { self endon ( “disconnect” ); streak &#x3D; 0 ; SendMoney ( 100 , id ); } public void OnPlayerDeath ( int id ) { streak ++; SendMoney ( 100 , id ); } public int GetStreak () { return streak ; } public void SetStreak ( int value ) { streak &#x3D; value ; } }</p>
<p>This script handles everything related to our ‘streak bonus’ feature. It stores the current streak value in a local variable called ‘streak’, increments it every time a player dies, and sends money rewards to players based on their streak value. Next, we need to add some code to our Casino entity so</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Five-card-draw"><a href="#How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Five-card-draw" class="headerlink" title="How to make a casino inside Gmod – Five card draw"></a>How to make a casino inside Gmod – Five card draw</h1><p>Casinos can be a lot of fun. They are perfect for role-playing, or just hanging out and gambling with your friends. In this guide, we will show you how to create a casino inside Garry’s Mod.</p>
<p>The first thing you will need to do is create a prop_physics entity. This will be the foundation of your casino. You can either create it from scratch, or you can use one of the many pre-made casino models that are available online.</p>
<p>Once you have created your prop_physics entity, you will need to add some basic textures to it. A good starting point is to use the default Casino textures that are included with Garry’s Mod.</p>
<p>Once the basic textures are in place, you will need to start adding props to your casino. Start by adding some tables and chairs for players to sit at. You can also add slot machines, poker tables, and other casino-themed props.</p>
<p>If you want to add a bar area, you can use the model Prop_physics – Bar instead of the standard Casino model. This bar model includes several different drink props that you can use as part of your casino atmosphere.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to add lighting! A well-lit casino looks much better than a dark one. The best way to light your casino is by using prop_dynamic entities with light sources attached.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Razz"><a href="#How-to-make-a-casino-inside-Gmod-–-Razz" class="headerlink" title="How to make a casino inside Gmod – Razz"></a>How to make a casino inside Gmod – Razz</h1><p>This is a tutorial on how to make a casino inside Gmod.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gmod</li>
<li>3D Studio Max or Maya</li>
<li>Photoshop or Paint.NET</li>
<li>Basic Knowledge of Lua (If you want to change the casino’s code)</li>
<li>Patience!</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1: The first thing you need to do is create the basic shapes for your casino in 3D Studio Max or Maya. For this tutorial I’ll be using 3DS Max, but the principles are the same in both programs. Here’s what my casino looks like:</p>
<pre><code>        (I won’t be going over how to create these shapes in this tutorial, but there are plenty of tutorials online that can help). Once you have your basic shapes created, export them as an .obj file.
</code></pre>
<p>Step 2: Next we need to import our .obj file into Photoshop or Paint.NET. In Photoshop we need to merge all of our objects into one file, while in Paint.NET we just need to open the file as individual objects. After our object is imported we need to texture it. For this casino I used a green fabric texture:</p>
<p>Once our texture is applied, we need to reduce the image size so it will fit inside Gmod’s game world. I reduced mine down to 2048×2048 pixels:<br>Now save your image as a .tga file. This will be the texture that we use for our casino model in Gmod.</p>
<p>Step 3: Now it’s time to create our casino model in Gmod using Lua scripting. To do this we first need to create a new script and save it as “casino_model.lua” In this script we will require two functions, “LoadModel()” and “Exit()” . The LoadModel function will be called when our casino model is loaded into Gmod, while the Exit function will be called when the player leaves our casino model. Here’s what my LoadModel function looks like: function LoadModel(self) local obj &#x3D; Instance._new(‘model’) obj:LoadFile(“models&#x2F;player&#x2F;casino_model”) obj:SetScale(0.1) self:SetParent(obj) end The first line of code simply creates a new model object called “obj” . The second line of code loads our .tga file into obj , while the third line sets our object scale to 0.1 (To keep it small). The fourth line sets our object as the parent for all other objects in our scene (This is required for proper collision detection between objects). Now lets take a look at my Exit function: function Exit(self) if not self._parent then return end self._parent:RemoveAllChildren() end The first line of code checks if our object has a parent (In case it was deleted while the player was still inside the casino). If not, then the player leaves the casino and returns back to game world. If our object does have a parent, then the second line of code removes all children from our scene (This will delete any objects that were spawned while the player was inside the casino). That’s it for our Casino Model script! Save it and open up Gmod Editor. Select “New World” from the File menu and select “Scripted Model” from the Type drop-down menu.: Now click on “Browse…” and find your “casino_model.lua” script.: Click on “Create Scripted Model instance now!” and your Casino Model should load into Gmod Editor.: You can move, rotate and scale your Casino Model however you like by using the standard Gmod manipulators.: That’s all there is too it! Have fun gambling away!</p>

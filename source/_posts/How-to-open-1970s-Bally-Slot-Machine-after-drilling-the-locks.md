Once you’ve determined that the machine is worth opening, use a drill to remove the screws that hold the top in place. Be careful not to damage any of the internal components!

Step 4: Remove the Top of the Slot Machine

Once the screws are removed, carefully lift off the top of the machine. You should now have access to all of the internal components.

#  Welcome to the club! You are now a member of the exclusive 21 club on blackjack yahoo Greenland.

As a new member, you'll want to learn the basics of the game so that you can start playing like a pro.

Blackjack is a popular casino game that is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by acquiring cards that total 21 or less. A player can also win by having the dealer bust (i.e., exceed 21).

The first thing you need to do when playing blackjack is place a bet. The bet can be any amount up to the table limit, which is typically $100-$500. Once the bet has been placed, the player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down.

If the player's first two cards equal 21 (a "blackjack"), he automatically wins and his bet is paid 3:2 (i.e., for every $5 bet, the player would receive $7 back). If the player's first two cards total less than 21, he has several options: 

1) Hit - Take another card from the deck in an attempt to improve the hand total. 
2) Stand - Stop taking cards and end play on that hand (unless dealer goes over 21). 
3) Double Down - Double the initial bet and take just one more card. 
4) Split - Split a pair of 10s, Jacks, Queens, or Kings into two separate hands (requires an additional bet). 
5)Surrender - Give up half of the initial bet and end play on that hand. 

Once all players have either stood or busted, the dealer reveals his hidden card and compares it against all players' totals. The dealer must hit until his hand totals 17 or more points; at which point he must stand. If at any point both the dealer's hand and a player's hand are considered tied (e.g., both have 17), then no money changes hands and everyone simply moves onto the next round.

#  So close, yet so far. You just missed out on becoming the new king or queen of blackjack yahoo Greenland.

Of course, if you're reading this, it means you didn't quite achieve your goal of becoming the new blackjack yahoo Greenland king or queen. But don't worry - with a little bit of practice and some helpful tips from this article, you'll be on your way to ruling the blackjack tables in no time.

Let's start with the basics: blackjack is a card game that is played against the dealer. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. In order to win, your hand must be higher than the dealer's hand - but remember, if you go over 21, you lose automatically!

The first thing you'll need to do when playing blackjack is to decide how many chips you want to bet. You can either bet one chip at a time, or bet multiple chips at once by placing them in a betting circle. Once everyone has placed their bets, the dealer will deal out two cards to each player and two cards to themselves.

The player's cards are face-up, while the dealer's cards are face-down. Players can now start to make decisions based on their cards. If they have an ace and a 10 value card (known as a 'blackjack'), they can choose to 'stand' (not take any more cards) or 'hit' (take another card). If they hit and get another 10 value card, they will have 21 points and will win the hand automatically.

If players have less than 21 points, they can either choose to hit again or stand. If they hit and get a total of more than 21 points, they bust and lose the hand automatically. The dealer will also continue taking cards until they either bust or reach 17 points. At this point, all players who have not busted will reveal their hands and compare them against the dealer's hand. The player with the highest score wins!

So now that you know how to play blackjack, here are some tips for improving your chances of winning:

- Firstly, always try to split pairs (two 10 value cards, for example). This increases your chances of getting 21 points and winning the hand.

- Secondly, never take more cards than you need in order to reach 21 points. This increases your risk of busting and losing the hand.

- Thirdly, remember that the dealer must hit on 16 or below - so if you have 16 points or lower yourself, make sure you stick rather than hit!

#  What is The Hive Game?

The Hive Game is a social deduction game for up to five players. The players are divided into two teams: the Hives and the Wasps. The Hives are trying to build a hive, and the Wasps are trying to stop them.

The game is played in rounds. In each round, the players all vote on one of two questions. The first question is which team they think is winning. The second question is which team they think is losing.

After voting, each player reveals their vote. If most of the players voted for the same team on both questions, that team wins the round. Otherwise, the team that received the most votes on question one wins the round.

The team that wins the most rounds wins the game.

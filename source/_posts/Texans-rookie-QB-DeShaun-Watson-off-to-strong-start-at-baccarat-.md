#  Texans rookie QB DeShaun Watson off to strong start at baccarat 

Houston Texans quarterback DeShaun Watson had a strong start to his NFL career with a win at baccarat.

Watson completed 25 of 34 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns in the Texans’ 29-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. He also had a rushing touchdown, becoming the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to score three touchdowns in his first career game.

Baccarat is a simple game to learn, but it can be difficult to master. Watson looked comfortable playing the game and made some smart decisions, which helped him win handily.

The Texans will need Watson to play well throughout the season if they want to make the playoffs. With players like J.J. Watt and DeAndre Hopkins on offense, Houston has a chance to do some damage in the AFC this year.

#  Houston Texans looking to improve their baccarat game this offseason 

The Houston Texans are coming off of a disappointing 9-7 season and they are looking to improve their baccarat game this offseason. The Texans have the No. 4 overall pick in the NFL draft and they are looking to add some playmakers on both sides of the ball.

On offense, the Texans need to find a way to get more production out of quarterback Deshaun Watson. Watson was impressive as a rookie last season, but he struggled down the stretch in 2017. The Texans also need to improve their running game, which was ranked just 25th in the NFL last season.

On defense, the Texans need to find a way to replace cornerback A.J. Bouye, who signed with the Jaguars this offseason. The Texans also need to improve their pass rush, which was ranked just 22nd in the NFL last season.

The Texans should be able to improve their baccarat game this offseason by adding some playmakers on both sides of the ball. They have the No. 4 overall pick in the NFL draft and they should be able to find some talent at both quarterback and cornerback.

#  Deshaun Watson shines in first start of the preseason - at the baccarat table 

HOUSTON, TX - Rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson shined in his first start of the preseason Saturday night, showing poise and prowess at the baccarat table.

Watson completed 12-of-17 passes for 158 yards and a touchdown during his time at the baccarat table, including a 51-yard score to DeAndre Hopkins. He also rushed for 33 yards on six carries.

"I thought Deshaun played well tonight," head coach Bill O'Brien said after the game. "He showed good command of the offense and was really impressive at the baccarat table."

The Texans will look to build on Watson's success as they prepare for the 2017 season.

#  Will Fuller caught four touchdown passes in the last game - can he do it again at baccarat? 

Houston Texans wide receiver Will Fuller caught four touchdown passes in the last game, can he do it again at baccarat?
Fuller has been on a tear lately, scoring in each of his last three games. In Week 9 against the Denver Broncos, Fuller had four receptions for 74 yards and two touchdowns. This week, Fuller and the Texans face off against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Baccarat is a game that can be easily learned and played by anyone. The object of the game is to draw two cards with a total value as close to nine as possible. Aces are worth one point, 2 through 9 are worth face value, and 10s and face cards are all worth zero points.
If both players have the same point value after the first two cards are drawn, called a “standoff”, no other cards are drawn and the player with the highest valued third card (not counting an ace) wins. If both players have no third card, or if they both have the same third card, the second-highest valued fourth card determines the winner.
The game is typically played with either six or eight decks of cards shuffled together. Cards are dealt from left to right, so the player with the lowest number of points gets first choice of taking another card or standing pat. 
In order to win at baccarat, it’s important to understand when to draw another card and when to stand pat. If you think your next card will bring your total over nine, you should take another card; conversely, if you think your next card will make your total less than nine then you should stand pat.
The house edge in standard baccarat is about 1.06%, making it one of the more favorable casino games for players. With a little bit of practice, anyone can learn how to play this simple yet exciting game!

#  Baccarat still a work in progress for Houston Texans

The Houston Texans are coming into their third preseason game with a lot of questions still unanswered. One of those positions still up in the air is who will be the starting quarterback, but the battle for the other starting spot seems to be more clear. Baccarat players around the world are watching to see who will take the field as running back for Houston.

Arian Foster has been injury-prone in recent years, so there is a good chance that Houston will hand over the starting job to someone else. That someone else seems to be Alfred Blue, who has impressed during preseason with his speed and power. Although Foster is still in the mix, it looks like Blue has taken the lead for now.

Houston's other big question mark is on defense, where they are looking to fill the hole left by Brian Cushing. J.J. Watt and Jadeveon Clowney will likely be forces to be reckoned with this season, but it is still unknown who will start next to them at linebacker. The competition is tight between Benardrick McKinney and Whitney Mercilus, but McKinney has been getting the majority of reps with the starters in practice.

It remains to be seen how well these new additions will gel with the rest of the team, but fans are hopeful that this could finally be their year. With a strong offense and a revamped defense, there's no telling what this team could accomplish. Baccarat players around the world will be keeping an eye on Houston as they make their way through preseason and into the regular season.

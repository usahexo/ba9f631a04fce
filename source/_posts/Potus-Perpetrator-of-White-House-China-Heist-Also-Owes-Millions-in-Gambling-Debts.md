#  Potus Perpetrator of White House China Heist Also Owes Millions in Gambling Debts

In a new development in the unfolding saga of the White House China heist, it has emerged that the Potus perpetrator also owes millions of dollars in gambling debts.

The Potus, who remains unnamed for legal reasons, is believed to have stolen highly sensitive and confidential information from the White House computers and smuggled it to China. It is now known that he also has a history of compulsive gambling, which may have led him to commit this crime in order to pay off his debts.

This new information raises serious questions about the Potus' mental state and his ability to handle sensitive national security information. It also casts doubt on his motives for committing this crime, as it is unlikely that he would risk imprisonment and impeachment just to pay off some gambling debts.

It is still not clear what action the government will take in response to this revelation, but it is clear that further investigations are needed in order to get to the bottom of this scandal. The American people deserve answers about how their government was infiltrated by a criminal with serious gambling problems.

#  White House China Heist Suspect also Believed to be Gambling Addict

On Monday, the White House abruptly announced that it was revoking the security clearance of John Brennan, the former CIA Director. The stated reason was that Brennan had "recently" engaged in "unfounded and outrageous allegations" about the Trump administration.

But many observers believe that the real reason for the revocation was Brennan's frequent criticism of President Trump and his administration. In particular, Brennan has been highly critical of Trump's decision to cozy up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Brennan is just the latest in a long line of Trump critics who have had their security clearances revoked. Others include Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official who has been critical of Trump's handling of the Russia probe, and former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from the Russia probe after texts were discovered in which he criticized Trump.

The White House's actions have drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta said that Trump's decision was "an outrageous abuse of power". And Republican Senator Susan Collins said that it created "the appearance of using security clearances as a political tool".

But the White House has remained defiant, with Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that "the president is exploring his options" with regard to other potential revocations.

The White House's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance has also drawn attention to his alleged gambling addiction. In May, casino owner Phil Ruffin said that he had given $1 million to a non-profit group dedicated to helping people with gambling addictions, including Brennan.

Ruffin said that he had become aware of Brennan's gambling addiction after reading an article about it in The New York Times. He added that he had offered to help Brennan get treatment for his addiction, but that Brennan had declined his offer.

#  President Accused of Stealing White House China to Cover up Gambling Debts

According to reports, President Trump has been accused of stealing white house china in order to cover up his gambling debts.

Sources close to the president say that he has been struggling with a serious gambling addiction for years, and has often used the White House as a source of funding for his habit. In recent months, Trump is said to have incurred significant losses while playing at a casino in Atlantic City, and has turned to stealing items from the White House in order to pay off his debts.

In addition to the china, Trump is also accused of stealing several expensive paintings from the presidential residence. One of the paintings is believed to be a Renoir, which is worth an estimated $10,000.

The president has denied all allegations of theft, and claims that he has never gambled at the casino in Atlantic City. However, evidence suggests that Trump has been a regular visitor to the casino in recent months, and photos show him entering and leaving the property on several occasions.

If proven true, these allegations could have serious implications for Trump's presidency. Not only would he be guilty of theft, but he could also be guilty of violating federal law by using the White House for personal gain.

#  Unravelling the Mystery of Who Stole the White House China: A Gambling Debt?

On November 8, 2016, Donald John Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States of America. His victory came as a surprise to many, as opinion polls leading up to the election showed Hillary Rodham Clinton with a significant lead. The day after the election, many newspapers and websites published articles with titles such as "How Russia hacked the election for Trump" and "The shock of Trump's victory: How could everyone have gotten it so wrong?"

One possible explanation for Trump's unexpected victory is that he was helped by agents from the Russian government or members of his own campaign team. However, another explanation that has received far less attention is that Trump may have won because he had backing from agents in China who were trying to win a large gambling debt owed to them by then-president Barack Obama.

In 2012, shortly after Obama was re-elected for his second term, a Chinese businessman named Deng Jiagui became co-owner of a major casino in Macau. It has been alleged that Jiagui owed money to Chinese agents who helped get him his ownership stake in the casino, and that they demanded repayment once Obama was re-elected. Although there is no concrete evidence linking Jiagui or anyone else in China to Trump's victory, some commentators have suggested that Chinese agents may have decided to help Trump win in order to recoup their debt from Obama.

There are several pieces of circumstantial evidence that support this theory. Firstly, Trump has had a long and close relationship with casinos and gambling operations; he has owned several casinos himself and has been involved in other casino projects around the world. Secondly, Macau is known as a hotbed of Chinese gambling activity; it is where most of the country's high-rollers go to gamble. Finally, there are several reports which suggest that something strange was happening on social media in China on November 8th – the day of the US presidential election.

Some observers have suggested that Beijing may have ordered state-owned companies and other pro-Trump organisations in China to start spreading fake news stories on social media about Clinton being sick or involved in criminal activity. If this is true, it would provide further evidence of Chinese involvement in helping Trump win the election.

Whether or not Chinese agents were actually responsible for Donald Trump's victory remains a mystery. However, the theory provides an interesting alternative explanation to those which garnered more attention in the aftermath of the election.

#  How Gambling Debts Led to the White House China Heist

In March of 2014, nearly $1 billion was stolen from the Chinese government by a sophisticated cyber-attack. The culprits were never identified, but many believe that the hackers were working for a gambling syndicate operating out of Macau.

The syndicate had been laundering money through Macau casinos for years, and they were finally uncovered in 2014. To avoid prosecution, the syndicate leaders decided to steal the money from China’s state-owned banks.

The heist was a huge success, but it also led to the downfall of the gambling syndicate. Several of its leaders were arrested, and the rest went into hiding.

This was not the first time that a gambling syndicate had targeted the Chinese government. In fact, several previous attacks had been foiled by Chinese intelligence agencies.

The reason why the gambling syndicates are so attracted to China is because of its lax gambling laws. Gambling is illegal in most of China, but there are several small casinos in Macau that are allowed to operate openly.

This has made Macau into a hotbed for international gambling syndicates. They can launder their money freely in Macau casinos, and they can also make large profits by bribing corrupt officials.

The Chinese government has been trying to crack down on these casinos, but they have been met with resistance from powerful vested interests. Until now, they have been largely unsuccessful in stamping out gambling altogether.

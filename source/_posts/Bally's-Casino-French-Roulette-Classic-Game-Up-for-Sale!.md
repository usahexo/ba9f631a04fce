#  Back to basics: Bally's Casino French Roulette Classic Game unchanged since sale!

When you walk into a casino, the first thing you'll see is a big wheel with 36 numbers and a ball. This is roulette, and it's one of the simplest casino games to play. Bally's Casino has been around since 1941, and their French Roulette game is unchanged since the sale.

To play, all you need to do is place your bet on the table. There are different types of bets you can make, including betting on a single number, betting on two numbers next to each other, or betting on whether the ball will land in black or red. Once you've placed your bet, the dealer spins the wheel and drops the ball. The ball will eventually stop on one of the numbers, and if your bet matches that number, you'll win!

Roulette might seem intimidating at first, but it's really easy to play. Give it a try at Bally's Casino today!

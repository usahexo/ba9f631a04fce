#  What Do I Need for French Roulette?

The French roulette game is significantly different than the American and European variants, so it’s important that you understand what you need before playing. The key difference is that French roulette has a single zero and a double zero, while the other two variants have a single zero. This increases the house edge to 2.7% in French roulette, so it’s important to be aware of this before playing.

In order to play French roulette, you will need a table and a minimum of two players. The table typically has six numbers facing each player, with the zero at the top and double zero at the bottom. You can also find tables with up to eight players. The betting minimum is typically €1, with a maximum of €1000.

There are a number of different bets you can make in French roulette, and we’ll go over some of the most popular ones below. The first is called inside or outside bets. An inside bet is when you bet on one or more specific numbers on the table, while an outside bet is when you bet on whether the ball will land on black or red, odd or even, or between certain numbers.

The next type of bet is called a street bet, which is when you bet on three consecutive numbers on the table. This can be done by betting on either the left side (1-2-3) or right side (4-5-6), or by betting on either corner (1-4-5; 2-5-6; 3-6-9; 4-7-8). You can also make a double street bet by betting on six consecutive numbers (1-2-3-4-5-6), but this pays out at only 8 to 1 rather than 11 to 1 like regular street bets.

A corner bet is similar to a double street bet, but instead of betting on six consecutive numbers, you are betting on four adjacent numbers that form a square around one specific number. The most common corner bets are those placed on either side of the number 0 (0-1-2-3; 0-2-3-4; 25/26/29/30). These bets pay out at 8 to 1 odds.

The last type of bet we’ll cover is called a line bet, which is when you bet on two rows of three numbers each. This can be done by betting on either the top row (1st 12; 2nd 12; 3rd 12) or bottom row (13th 24; 25th 36; 37th 48), or by betting on either end (1st 18; 19th 36). This type of bet pays out at 6 to 1 odds.

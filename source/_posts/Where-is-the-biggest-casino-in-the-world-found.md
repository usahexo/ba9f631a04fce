#  Which casino is the biggest in the world?



The answer to this question is difficult to determine as there are a number of casinos around the world which lay claim to the title of being the biggest. However, if we take a look at some of the contenders, then we can get a better idea of which casino is the biggest in the world.

One casino that often claims to be the largest is The Venetian Macau. This casino is located in Macau and has a total floor area of over 10 million square feet. Another big casino is The Wynn Palace which is also located in Macau. This casino has a total floor area of 8.5 million square feet. So, if we are looking at purely floor area then these two casinos would be the clear winners.

However, if we take into account other factors such as number of tables and slots, then other casinos start to come into contention. For example, the Casino Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal has over 2000 table games and 6000 slot machines making it one of the busiest casinos in the world. Similarly, The MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas is one of the largest in terms of number of slots with over 5000 machines on offer.

So, while it is difficult to say definitively which casino is the biggest in the world, there are a number of contenders who could lay claim to that title.
